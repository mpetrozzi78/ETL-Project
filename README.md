# ETL-Project

The goal of this project is to analyse the data analyst job vacancies in the major US cities and compare the offered salaries witht he cost of living of this city.

I have web scraped Indeed website for data analyst jobs in major US cities.
I have also used a csv file found on Kaggle regarding the cost of living all around the world (https://www.kaggle.com/andytran11996/cost-of-living). Data was taken in 2017.
